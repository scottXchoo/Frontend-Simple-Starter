# Simple Starter for NextJS 13+, Tailwind CSS 3.3 and TypeScript

> 🔥 Simple Starter for NextJS 13+, Tailwind CSS 3.3 and TypeScript 🎉 Inspired by "[Next-js-Boilerplate](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate)".

I love [Next-js-Boilerplate](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate) project, but there are some libraries I don't want to use, so I decided it was heavy and difficult to use. (Thanks to [Remi Wg](https://github.com/ixartz))

So I made a simpler and easier Next.js template for beginners. It's a project with only Next.js, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. I hope you can use it well🙇🏻‍♂️

Clone this project and use it to create your own [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

## Features

- 💎 Integrate with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Strict Mode for TypeScript and React 18
- 📏 Linter with ESLint (default NextJS, NextJS Core Web Vitals, Tailwind CSS and Airbnb configuration)
- 💖 Code Formatter with Prettier

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+ and npm
